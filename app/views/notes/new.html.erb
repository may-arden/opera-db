# create a form here for note submission ... should just be a text box in which user can write
# a string 

# or should it be a single form to enter everything into ... 

song title: "quando m'en vo"
opera title: "la boheme"
note contents: "this is where user will write a note about the song and its context within the story"

submit.

i want the user to have the following functionality:

log out
add a song
look at all song titles for which user has saved notes
add a note
look at all notes 
look at all opera titles for which user has saved notes/songs
be able to navigate back home - '/users/show'
