# create a form here for note submission ... should just be a text box in which user can write
# a string 

# or should it be a single form to enter everything into ... 

song title: "quando m'en vo"
opera title: "la boheme"
note contents: "this is where user will write a note about the song and its context within the story"

submit.

i want the user to have the following functionality:

log out

add a song ('songs/new') where the user can save song title 

look at a list of all song titles for which user has saved notes ('songs/index')
and be able to click on the title to take them to that specific song page where the notes live

look at a specific song ('songs/show') which has the notes for the song 
displayed below its title & opera to which it belongs, eg:

jewel song / FAUST
"note is displayed here"

add a note ('notes/new') using a form 

look at all notes ('notes/show') which will display the song title & opera title above the body of the note

look at all opera titles for which user has saved notes & songs ('operas/index') ??

be able to navigate back home - '/users/show'
